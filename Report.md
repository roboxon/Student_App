# Student Weekly Reporting System (C# Application)

## Overview

The Student Weekly Reporting System is designed to help students document their learning activities throughout their training program. The system provides a structured way to create, manage, and submit hourly, daily, and weekly reports, while enforcing date restrictions and efficiently calculating report status. Implemented in C#, this application leverages client-side processing to minimize server load.

## Core Features

1. **Calendar Week Selection**
   - Students select target week for reporting
   - Color-coded visualization of report status
   - Date restrictions based on student enrollment period

2. **Structured Report Creation**
   - Subject and topic selection from curriculum
   - Hourly reports linked to working schedule
   - Daily summaries
   - Weekly overviews

3. **Local Data Management**
   - Save reports locally before submission
   - Client-side calculation of report status
   - Efficient API usage to support 5000+ students

4. **Report Submission**
   - Upload to server when complete
   - Delete local copy after successful submission
   - Status tracking for submitted reports

## UI Components and Workflow

### 1. Calendar View with Status Visualization

The calendar view displays month-by-month overview of reporting status with color-coded week indicators:

- **Green**: Week has complete reports covering all working hours
- **Yellow**: Week has partial reports (some hours not reported)
- **Red**: Week has no reports created
- **Gray**: Dates outside valid reporting range (future dates or before enrollment)

#### Status Colors
- Saved draft reports appear with blue background
- Submitted reports appear with green background
- No reports appear with default white/gray background

### 4. Local Saving and Server Synchronization

The system provides two key actions for report management:

#### Save Locally Button
- Saves the entire week's report data as JSON on the local machine
- Filename format: `WeekReport_YYYY-MM-DD.json` (using first day of week)
- Provides offline capability and data backup
- Updates status indicators

#### Upload/Sync Button
- Sends the locally saved data to the server
- Includes week_date and authentication token in request header
- Deletes local file after successful upload
- Updates sync status indicators

The workflow is:
1. Student updates hourly reports
2. Clicks "Save Report Locally" to store data as JSON
3. When ready, clicks "Upload/Sync Report to Server"
4. System sends data to server and deletes local file upon success
5. Status updates to show "Synced with Server"

### 5. Weekly Status Calculation

The system leverages client-side processing to calculate weekly report status:

#### Client-Side Calculation Benefits
- Reduced server load (critical for supporting 5000+ students)
- Faster UI updates
- Works even when offline
- Seamless user experience

#### Status Calculation Logic
- **Complete**: All working hours for the week have reports
- **Partial**: Some hours have reports, others don't
- **None**: No reports created for the week

The status calculations happen entirely on the client side using:
- Student's working_days schedule to determine required hours
- Locally stored report data to determine completed hours
- Efficient caching to minimize recalculations

### 6. Data Structure
